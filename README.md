# FellStyle

A collection of styles for use with [BookGen](https://github.com/marrus-sh/BookGen/) inspired by older English typography.
Featuring:

+ Standard, Largetype, and Trade PDF forms
+ Additional information on chapter-only PDFs for ease of distribution
+ CSS stylesheet

## Prerequisites

PDF styles are designed for use with XeLaTeX (the BookGen default).

Requires the following additional TeX packages to be installed on your system:

+ `ifmtarg`
+ `soul`

## Custom Info

`FellStyle.publicationdetails` can be used to provide extended details about the publication of a work; for example, an extended copyright statement.

### Fonts (for PDF)

Both PDF styles require the [IM Fell](https://iginomarini.com/fell/the-revival-fonts/) fonts.
(If IM Fell website is having issues, an archived download link is here:â€‚<https://web.archive.org/web/20190406165622/http://iginomarini.com/fell/wp-content/uploads/IMFellTypesClass.zip>.)

The Standard Edition style requires [Junicode](http://junicode.sourceforge.net/).

The Largetype Edition style requires [Charis SIL](https://software.sil.org/charis/).

The Trade Edition style requires Palatino.

### Caveats:

The IM Fell fonts used in the Standard and Largetype Editions provide inconsistent results (in my experience) when printing PDFs with embedded fonts.
Consequently, you may want to use the `VECTORIZE` option in BookGen when compiling these editions for print.

The Trade Edition conforms to industry standards (notably, setting equal top and bottom margins) and uses only the Palatino font.
It is intended for Print-on-Demand distribution and similar.

## Makefile configuration

To make usage of these styles simpler, you might want to set up a makefile in your work directory which automatically generates symlinks to their locations.
The provided `Makefile` is intended to aid in this process.
The following is an example makefile that one might set up which makes use of it:

	SHELL = /bin/sh

	# Replace with the paths to these repositories on your device:
	BOOKGEN := BookGen
	FELLSTYLE := FellStyle

	# BookGen configuration:
	# DRAFTS := Drafts
	# export DRAFTS

	default: fellstyle bookgen

	# BookGen default make:
	bookgen:
		@$(MAKE) -ef "$(BOOKGEN)/GNUmakefile"

	# FellStyle default make:
	fellstyle:
		@$(MAKE) -f "$(FELLSTYLE)/Makefile"

	# Do not pattern-match this makefile:
	Makefile: ;

	# Always pass all unmatched patterns through to BookGen after running a FellStyle make:
	%: fellstyle
		@$(MAKE) -ef "$(BOOKGEN)/GNUmakefile" $@

	# Delete generated files:
	clobber distclean gone:
		@$(MAKE) -f "$(FELLSTYLE)/Makefile" gone
		@$(MAKE) -ef "$(BOOKGEN)/GNUmakefile" gone

	.PHONY: default bookgen fellstyle clobber distclean gone
